# ArTEZtic
Through a DAO, we want to create a self-sustained coalition of NFT artists to foster climate awareness and nudge climate action. 

## Summary
The Arteztic DAO will act as a decentralised autonomous NGO in service of environmental causes within the arts. We are a group of environmentally-minded NFT artists who have decided to work together to amplify the impact of our artworks, identify and adopt sustainable working practices, and onboard and support the wider community via a donation funding mechanism.

Fully community led, the DAO will decide collectively on the onboarding of new members, on the distribution of funds gathered from the sales of the NFTs donated by the members, the selection of a list of NGOs to support and the selection of members' projects to support.

The DAO will also have a public facing website presenting the group and its purpose, a permanent online gallery showcasing artworks from the members, temporary virtual exhibitions, the presentation of our members-led projects and an ongoing call for members.

For our MVP, we are focusing on onboarding new members through a governance mechanism. The next steps are as follows:

- Enable art donations in order to have a shared-pool of funds to be distributed between the artists, the members and a roster of selected NGO's
- Create a permanent autonomous online exhibition with the environmental NFT art donated
- Enable the production and support of projects developed directly by the DAO

*A note on our name: the word Arteztic can be written ArTEZtic for a clearer reference to the Tezos blockchain, on which our artistic project is being built. It also merges with the word Arctic, to reference the environmental nature of our mission, and of course the word Artistic.*

## Vision
An independent coalition of NFT artists with a shared-goal: prioritising the environment in the creation of art. 

## Mission 
The idea of this coalition is to bring together ‘green’ NFT artists and use the power of community and collaboration to move away from the restrictive models of the conventional art market, and the analogous PoW NFT model.
An ideals-driven use of PoS blockchain technology in combination with a governance DAO will hopefully be able to introduce a new form of collective value creation without traditional intermediaries, and promote the decentralized distribution of further value for an expanding community.
This DAO will run on the Tezos Blockchain and be self-sustained thanks to the donations of art by artists - the funds generated from the sale of these artworks will be distributed in a way as to further the vision of the DAO and encourage and invite new members.
